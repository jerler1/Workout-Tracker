To intall this application using prebuilt html and css elements involved this:

1. Install the npm dependencies.
1. Type npm run seed.
1. Type node server.js.

#### **Trials**

---
The front end was provided and doesn't seem to work quite the way I would like it too.

Learning how to optimize the mongoose queries was a fun dip into documentation.

#### **Usage**

---

To start a exercise click "Add Exercise" on the root directory and enter the information in the form.  If you wish to continue that exercise click "Continue Exercise", if not, then click "End Exercise".  There are two links in the top left: "Fitness Tracker" and "Dashboard".  Fitness Tracker will send you back to the base route, and Dashboard will give you the stats of your past seven workouts.
